Config::Trivial Version 0.80
============================

This is "Yet Another" simple module to read (and write)
trivial configuration files. The files are very simple,
simply consisting of key values pairs separated by the
first space.

ALSO SEE

There are LOTS of other configuration reading and writing
modules on CPAN, please check them all carefully before
installing this one.

INSTALLATION

To install this module type the following:

   perl Makefile.PL
   make
   make test
   make install
or
   perl Build.PL
   ./Build
   ./Build test
   ./Build install

DEPENDENCIES

This module requires only core modules:
    Perl 5.10
    strict
    warnings
    Carp

The tests will use non-core modules if available
but these are not required for normal use.
