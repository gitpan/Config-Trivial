Config::Trivial Version 0.51
============================

This is "Yet Another" simple module to read (and write)
trivial configuration files. The files are very simple,
simply consisting of key values pairs separated by the
first space.

It is based on an earlier (unpublished) module called
Config-SimpleConf.

ALSO SEE

There are LOTS of other configuration reading and writing
modules on CPAN, please check them all carefully before
installing this one.

INSTALLATION

To install this module type the following:

   perl Makefile.PL
   make
   make test
   make install

DEPENDENCIES

This module requires only core modules:
	Perl 5.6
	strict
	warnings
	Carp

The tests will use non-core modules if available
but these are not required for normal use.
